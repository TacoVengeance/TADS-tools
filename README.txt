This repository contains truemechasonic's tools for TADS2 and TADS3:
 scads2: An updated version of an existing TADS2 decompiler
 scads3: An updated version of an existing TADS3 decompiler
 tads2manip: My custom-made tool for manipulating TADS2 games.

The current version of tads2manip has two main features:
	Extract resources (images) from a TADS2 game.
	Modify a TADS2 game using custom patch files.

I'm writing these readmes years after I coded these tools;
 my apologies for how poorly designed & explained it all is.
